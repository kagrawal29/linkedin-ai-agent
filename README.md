# LinkedIn AI Agent

## Purpose
Build a local-first AI agent‚Äîpowered by Browser Use + OpenAI GPT-4‚Äîthat autonomously (or with supervision) scrolls your LinkedIn feed, filters posts, researches context, and engages with valuable, human-grade comments, reactions, and messages.

## Project Setup

The initial project structure has been created as per the requirements specification. This includes:
- All Python modules (`interpreter.py`, `harvester.py`, etc.)
- Configuration files (`settings.yaml`, `persona.md`, `filters.yaml`) in the `config/` directory.
- A `requirements.txt` file with initial dependencies.
- A `.gitignore` file for Python projects.

### Next Steps

1.  **Initialize GitHub Repo**: Create a new repository on GitHub and push the initial commit.
2.  **Setup Virtual Environment**: Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
3.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

With the setup complete, the project is ready for the implementation of the core features, starting with the `Prompt Interpreter`.
