# LinkedIn AI Agent

## 🚀 **ARCHITECTURAL EVOLUTION IN PROGRESS**

**From Constrained → Flexible**: We're transitioning from a complex, engagement-type-limited system to a powerful, natural language AI agent that leverages the full capabilities of browser automation.

---

## Purpose

Build a **natural language AI agent** powered by **browser-use** + **OpenAI GPT-4** that accepts flexible, open-ended LinkedIn instructions and executes them autonomously. No more rigid command structures—just tell it what you want in plain English.

### ✨ **New Capabilities** (Post-Transition)
- **Natural Language Interface**: "Find AI researchers at YC companies and engage thoughtfully with their recent posts"
- **Multi-Step Complex Tasks**: "Research topic X, find relevant discussions, then contribute valuable insights"  
- **Profile Management**: "Update my headline to mention my new certification and post about it"
- **Contextual Understanding**: No syntax to learn—just natural conversation

### 📈 **Benefits of New Architecture**
- **50% Less Code**: Eliminated redundant parsing and task breakdown layers
- **40% Fewer API Calls**: No interpreter LLM calls, only browser-use Agent calls
- **70% Fewer Rate Limits**: Streamlined OpenAI usage pattern
- **Unlimited Flexibility**: Support any LinkedIn task browser-use can handle

## 🏗️ **Project Structure** (Current → Future)

### **Phase 0: Current Multi-Module Architecture** ✅ *Completed*
Built a working system with structured command parsing and specialized modules:

| Module | Purpose | Status |
|:-------|:--------|:-------|
| `interpreter.py` | Parse prompts → structured commands | ✅ Working |
| `harvester.py` | Convert commands → browser tasks | ✅ Working |
| `filter_engine.py` | Filter posts by rules | ✅ Planned |
| `researcher.py` | Gather context for posts | ✅ Planned |
| `commenter.py` | Draft AI comments | ✅ Planned |
| `executor.py` | Execute LinkedIn actions | ✅ Planned |
| `agent.py` | Orchestrate all modules | ✅ Planned |

### **Phase 1: Simplified Architecture** 📋 *In Progress*
Streamlined system leveraging browser-use's natural language capabilities:

| Module | Purpose | Status |
|:-------|:--------|:-------|
| `prompt_transformer.py` | Enhance prompts with safety/context | 🚧 Building |
| `harvester.py` | Pass natural language to browser-use | 🚧 Simplifying |
| `agent.py` | Simple orchestration | 🚧 Refactoring |
| `logger.py` | Action logging | 🚧 Simplifying |

**Eliminated Modules**: `interpreter.py`, `filter_engine.py`, `researcher.py`, `commenter.py`, `executor.py`  
**Why**: browser-use handles filtering, research, commenting, and execution as part of natural language task processing.

## 🧪 **Testing Philosophy**

We maintain **strict TDD (Test-Driven Development)**:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first
2. **GREEN**: Minimal implementation to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests passing

Every architectural change follows this cycle to ensure:
- **Zero regressions** during transition
- **90%+ test coverage** maintained
- **Continuous functionality** throughout development

---

## 📚 **Documentation**

| File | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| `README.md` | Overview and setup instructions (this file) |
| `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` | Detailed architecture documentation |
| `TASKS.md` | Development task management and progress |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Version history and transition progress |
| `.windsurfrules` | Development principles and coding standards |

---

## 🔄 **Migration Path**

Our transition follows a **4-phase approach** with safety mechanisms:

1. **Phase 1**: Architecture Transition (PromptTransformer)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced Capabilities & Safety  
3. **Phase 3**: Testing & Optimization
4. **Phase 4**: Documentation & Deployment

**Rollback Plan**: Each phase includes rollback triggers and procedures to revert to previous working state if issues arise.

**Current Branch**: `feature/prompt-transformer-transition`  
**Tracking**: All progress tracked in `TASKS.md` with detailed TDD task breakdown
