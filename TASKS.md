## **COMPLETED WORK (Previous Architecture)**

### âœ… Day 1-2: Foundation & Constrained Interpreter
- [x] **Project Setup**
  - [x] Repository scaffolding, environment setup
  - [x] Git initialization and GitHub repository
  - [x] Python virtual environment and dependencies
  - [x] Documentation structure (`SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.windsurfrules`)

- [x] **Constrained Interpreter Implementation (TDD)**
  - [x] **RED**: Failing tests for structured command parsing
  - [x] **GREEN**: `PromptInterpreter` class with OpenAI structured parsing
  - [x] **REFACTOR**: System prompt for engagement type validation
  - [x] **Command** model with engagement type constraints (`like`, `comment`, `share`, `fetch_posts`)

- [x] **Harvester Integration (TDD)**
  - [x] **RED**: Failing tests for browser-use integration
  - [x] **GREEN**: Command-to-task conversion logic
  - [x] **REFACTOR**: FetchedPost model and parsing logic

- [x] **Flask UI Implementation**
  - [x] Basic web interface with prompt input
  - [x] Dual endpoints: `/api/parse` and `/api/process_prompt_and_fetch`
  - [x] Post display functionality

- [x] **Testing Infrastructure**
  - [x] Unit tests for interpreter (`tests/test_interpreter.py`)
  - [x] Unit tests for harvester (`tests/test_harvester.py`)
  - [x] End-to-end browser testing validation

### âœ… **Key Learnings from Previous Implementation**
- **Rate Limiting Issues**: OpenAI calls in interpreter + browser-use = frequent rate limits
- **Over-Engineering**: Structured parsing duplicates browser-use's natural language capabilities
- **Limited Flexibility**: Engagement type constraints prevent complex multi-step tasks
- **Architecture Insight**: browser-use is designed for direct natural language input

## **ROLLBACK PLAN**

If critical issues arise during transition:
- [ ] **Phase 1 Rollback**: Revert to `interpreter.py` + `Command` objects
- [ ] **Phase 2 Rollback**: Disable advanced features, keep basic transformer
- [ ] **Full Rollback**: Git revert to pre-transition commit

**Rollback Triggers:**
- [ ] >50% increase in error rate
- [ ] Critical functionality completely broken
- [ ] Unresolvable security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance degradation >2x

This plan maintains our TDD discipline while transitioning to a more powerful, flexible architecture. Each phase builds incrementally with continuous validation of functionality.
