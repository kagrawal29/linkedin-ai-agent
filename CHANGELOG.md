#### âœ… Phase 1: Architecture Transition (COMPLETED)
- **PromptTransformer**: âœ… Complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with full test coverage
- **Harvester Simplification**: âœ… Direct natural language prompt handling (removed Command objects)
- **Flask App Migration**: âœ… Single `/api/process` endpoint with streamlined flow
- **Test Migration**: âœ… All tests rewritten for string-based prompts vs structured commands

#### âœ… Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities & Safety (COMPLETED)
- **Context-Aware Enhancement**: Multi-step task breakdown and LinkedIn-specific context
- **Professional Guidelines**: Persona integration for personalized, appropriate responses
- **Safety Validation**: Malicious prompt detection and content filtering
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user feedback

#### âœ… Phase 3: Debugging & Visibility Enhancements (COMPLETED)
- **Enhanced UI Visibility**: Transformed prompt display with collapsible sections
- **Agent Action Logging**: Real-time streaming of browser-use agent actions
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Post parsing and display in UI
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Categorized errors with suggested actions

#### âœ… Phase 4: Chrome CDP Persistent Login (COMPLETED)
- **CDP Connection**: Successful connection to user's logged-in Chrome browser
- **Session Preservation**: LinkedIn session maintained without re-login
- **Automated Connection**: AI agent automatically connects to Chrome CDP
- **Production Testing**: Real-world validation with persistent LinkedIn sessions

### Added
- **Architectural Transition Plan**: Comprehensive 4-phase plan in `TASKS.md`
  - Phase 1: Architecture Transition (PromptTransformer)
  - Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities & Safety
  - Phase 3: Debugging & Visibility Enhancements
  - Phase 4: Chrome CDP Persistent Login
- **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable goals (50% code reduction, 40% fewer API calls, 70% fewer rate limits)
- **PromptTransformer Module**: New flexible prompt enhancement system replacing constrained interpreter
- **Simplified Flask App**: New `/api/process` endpoint integrating PromptTransformer + Harvester
- **Chrome Status UI**: Real-time Chrome CDP connection monitoring with visual indicators
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error categorization and user feedback

### Changed
- **Development Methodology**: Strict TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) maintained throughout transition
- **Architecture Vision**: From engagement-type-limited system to general-purpose AI agent
- **Harvester Module**: Simplified to accept natural language strings instead of Command objects
- **Test Strategy**: All tests updated to use proper mocking to prevent unwanted browser automation
- **User Interface**: Enhanced with Chrome status monitoring and debugging visibility

### Fixed
- **ðŸ”§ CRITICAL: Prevented Unwanted Browser Automation During Tests** (2025-06-12)
  - **Issue**: Tests were accidentally launching real browsers and navigating to random websites (x.com, facebook.com)
